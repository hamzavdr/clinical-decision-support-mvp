    "page_body": "I proudly present the updated 2024 editions of both the Primary Healthcare (PHC) and \nAdult Hospital Level (AHL) Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) and Essential \nMedicines List (EML). These guidelines aim to enhance transparency and support the \ndelivery of high-quality treatment options at both PHC and hospital levels. They reflect \nthe evolving clinical needs of our population as well as the introduction of new medicines.  \n \nUniversal Health Coverage (UHC) aims to eliminate disparities in healthcare access and \noutcomes, providing financial protection and access to quality healthcare for all South \nAfricans, as mandated by the constitution of South Africa. The National Essential \nMedicines List Committee (NEMLC) has incrementally increased the use of Health \nTechnology Assessment processes in the selection of essential medicines, providing \ntransparent priority-setting and value-based guidance for efficient resource allocation. The \nPHC and AHL STGs and EML are a key pillar of UHC, laying the groundwork for structuring \nhealth service benefits and ensuring equitable access to safe, effective and affordable \nmedicines for all.  \n \nI commend the diligent work of the PHC and AHL Expert Review Committee (ERC), along \nwith the NEMLC, in developing the 2024 editions of the PHC and AHL STGs and EML \naccording to good governance and evidence-based decision principles.  \n \nI encourage stakeholders across all sectors to actively participate in the continuous review, \ndevelopment and implementation of these guidelines. I encourage engagement with the \nNEMLC process of STG development through the external comment process. I appreciate \nyour engagement in presentations and webinars hosted by the NDoH, as well as \ndissemination of communication published on the National Department of Health web \npage. Your active involvement is crucial for the successful implementation of these STGs \nand the improvement of health outcomes for our nation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDR PA MOTSOALEDI, MP \nMINISTER OF HEALTH \nDATE: 25 June 2025",

    "page_body": "INTRODUCTION \n \nThe Primary Healthcare (PHC) and Adult Hospital Level (AHL) Standard Treatment \nGuidelines (STGs) and Essential Medicines List (EML) enable the equitable access to \nsafe, effective and affordable essential medicines across South Africa.  \n \nHistorically, the PHC and AHL Expert Review Committees (ERCs) responsible for \ndeveloping the PHC and AHL STGs were appointed as separate Committees. However, \nin 2020 the Committees were merged to streamline efforts and optimise resources, \nensuring a seamless continuum of care between the PHC and AHL of care. The review \ncycle for these STGs commenced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating \na shift in priorities to address emerging needs and challenges faced by the healthcare \nsystem during the pandemic.  \n \nThe ERC reviews the STGs and EML according to a topic prioritisation framework that \nincludes consideration of clinical need, efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and \nequity, presenting recommendations to the National Essential Medicines List Committee \n(NEMLC) for appraisal and ratification. The multidisciplinary team, which includes clinical \nexperts, clinical pharmacologists and evidence-review and guideline-development \nmethodologists has strengthened the STG development process. The National \nDepartment of Health’s Essential Drugs Programme team supports this process and has \nensured collaboration and alignment with other advisory groups in updating these \nguidelines.  \n \nThe NEMLC has incorporated the latest advances in clinical care into various disorder and \nchapter updates, expanding medicine treatment options including (but not limited to) Blood \nand Blood-Forming Organs, HIV, Mental Health, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, as well as \nPalliative Care. Notably, the AHL STGs and EML features a new chapter on Adult Critical \nCare, developed through extensive consultation across both public and private sectors. \nThis chapter aims to enhance our response capabilities and ensure comprehensive care \nfor critically ill patients.  \n \nThe 2024 editions of the PHC and AHL STGs and EML reflects the National Department \nof Health’s commitment to continually evolving and enhancing the quality and accessibility \nof healthcare across our country.\nDR SSS BUTHELEZI \nDIRECTOR-GENERAL: HEALTH \nDATE: 11 June 2025",

    "page_body": "The WHO describes Essential medicines as those that satisfy the priority \nhealth care needs of the population. Essential medicines are intended to be \navailable within the context of functioning health systems at all times in \nadequate quantities, in the appropriate dosage forms, with assured quality \nand adequate information, and at a price the individual and the community \ncan afford. \n \nThe concept of essential medicines is forward-looking. It incorporates the \nneed to regularly update medicines selections to: \n» reflect new therapeutic options and changing therapeutic needs;  \n» the need to ensure medicine quality; and \n» the need for continued development of better medicines, medicines for\nemerging diseases, and medicines to meet changing resistance patterns. \n \nEffective health care requires a judicious balance between preventive and \ncurative services. A crucial and often deficient element in curative services is \nan adequate supply of appropriate medicines. In the health objectives of the \nNational Drug Policy, the government of South Africa clearly outlines its \ncommitment to ensuring availability and accessibility of medicines for all \npeople. These are as follows:  \n» To ensure the availability and accessibility of essential medicines to all\ncitizens.  \n» To ensure the safety, efficacy and quality of medicines.  \n» To ensure good prescribing and dispensing practices.  \n» To promote the rational use of medicines by prescribers, dispensers and\npatients through provision of the necessary training, education and \ninformation.  \n» To promote the concept of individual responsibility for health, preventive\ncare and informed decision-making.  \n \nAchieving these objectives requires a comprehensive strategy that not only \nincludes improved supply and distribution, but also appropriate and extensive \nhuman resource development. The implementation of an Essential Drugs \nProgramme (EDP) forms an integral part of this strategy, with continued \nrationalisation of the variety of medicines available in the public sector as a \nfirst priority. The private sector is encouraged to use these guidelines and \nmedicine list wherever appropriate. \n \nThe criteria for the selection of essential medicines for Primary Health Care in \nSouth Africa were based on the WHO guidelines for drawing up a national \nEML. Essential medicines are selected with due regard to disease prevalence, \nevidence on efficacy and safety, and comparative cost. \n \nThe implementation of the concept of essential medicines is intended to be \nflexible and adaptable to many different situations. It remains a national \nresponsibility to determine which medicines are regarded as essential.",

    "page_body": "Principles \nThe National Drug Policy1 provides for an Essential Drugs Programme (EDP) - \na key component of promoting rational medicines use. Medicines are included \nor removed from the Essential Medicines List (EML) following an evidence-\nbased review of safety and effectiveness and considering cost and other \nrelevant practice factors. The review process is dynamic, and starts with \nprioritisation of  chapters, medicines, or disease areas. The EML, STGs, and \nthe reviews informing them are then updated and published on an ongoing \nbasis.  Each  new review or update involves seeking input and comments from \nexternal stakeholders. Stakeholders are also given opportunity to input prior to \nfinal publication. All reasonable steps are taken to align the Standard Treatment \nGuidelines (STGs) with Department of Health guidelines available at the time of \nreview. Some recommendations might not be aligned with the indications or \ndoses included in South African Health Products Regulatory Authority \n(SAHPRA) approved professional information but are guided by the best \navailable scientific evidence.\nThe perspective adopted in the Primary Healthcare (PHC) STGs is that of a \ncompetent authorised prescriber practising in a public sector facility. The \nSTGs serve as a standard for practice but do not replace sound clinical \njudgment. It is important to remember that the treatments recommended are \nguidelines only, based on the assumption that prescribers can manage \npatients with the relevant conditions. This includes rational prescribing in the \nelderly and palliative care, as the use of some medicines, especially as people \nget older or more ill, can cause more harm than good. Optimizing medication \nuse through targeted de-prescribing is vital in managing chronic conditions, \navoiding adverse effects, improving outcomes, reducing pill burden, and \nmaintaining or improving quality of life.\nThe PHC EML and STGs allow for managing patients with relatively common \nconditions at the primary level of care. They also guide the referral of patients \nwith more complex or uncommon conditions to facilities with the skills and \nresources to provide further investigation and management. As such, they are \na progression to the Adult and Paediatric hospital-level EMLs and STGs.\nThe PHC STGs and EML should be used by healthcare workers providing \ncare at clinics, community health centres, mobile clinics, outreach \nprogrammes, and gateway or out-patient clinics at hospitals.  \nPharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committees (PTCs) are the primary \nimplementing bodies of medicine-related governance in the provinces, \ndistricts and health establishments in South Africa. They are a crucial \ncomponent of the medicine supply chain as the custodians of medicine \ngovernance and the rational selection and use of medicines at all levels of \n \n1 National Drugs Policy, 1996. https://www.gov.za/documents/national-drugs-policy\nxxviii",

This flexible approach aims to promote better utilisation of resources \nwhile providing access to healthcare that is more convenient for patients.\nGiven that the STGs and EMLs for the various levels of care are reviewed at \ndifferent times, there may be periods when they are not perfectly aligned. \nLikewise, updated STGs and EMLs will not always be synchronised with \npublic sector pharmaceutical tenders, and Provincial and local PTCs should \nfacilitate the phase in/out of the relevant essential medicines. \n \nLocal formularies \nA formulary is a continually updated list of medicines and related information \non the diagnosis, prophylaxis, or treatment of disease and the promotion of \nhealth to satisfy the needs of the majority of the population served by a \nparticular health establishment/s.3  \n \nAll EML medicines should be available at the relevant level of care based on \nthe package of services provided at a particular health establishment/s.

Sedation is unlikely to be acceptable to a \nstudent, but an older patient with insomnia may welcome this side effect. \nThis is where concordance plays a vital role. \n \nNotes on prescribing in chronic conditions. \n» Do not change doses without good reason. \n» Never blame anyone or anything for non-adherence before fully investigating",

This \ngrouping is also used to identify antibiotics that are priorities for monitoring \nand surveillance.  \n \nMost medicines remain effective even if used by many people for prolonged \nperiods. Unfortunately, antibiotics are an important exception as they can \nbecome ineffective because of anti-microbial resistance. \n  \nANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE \nAntibiotic resistance refers to the ability of microorganisms to withstand the \neffects of an antibiotic. \n  \nBacteria are said to develop resistance when they are no longer inhibited or \nkilled by a given antibiotic. \n \nInappropriate use of antibiotics favours the emergence and spread of \nantibiotic resistance, amplifying natural ability of bacteria to resist. \nIn order to keep antibiotics effective, we need to take them only when needed \nand strictly as directed by the prescriber / healthcare professional \n \nFurthermore, there is a need to select the right antibiotic for a given infection \nwhen they are needed. Those antibiotics that offer the best therapeutic \nadvantage while minimizing the risk of resistance should be privileged. \n \nThe aim of the WHO AWaRe antibiotic categorization is to provide a tool to \nuse antibiotics safely and effectively.",

Transmission \nof HIV from mother to infant may occur during pregnancy, delivery and/or breastfeeding. \nWithout intervention, 25–40% of infants born to women living with HIV may become \ninfected. With appropriate interventions, maternal mortality as well as perinatal \ntransmission of HIV can be substantially reduced. 4% of women who were initially HIV-\nnegative become positive later during pregnancy. Repeat HIV testing is essential. \nFor comprehensive information on the care of HIV-infected pregnant women refer to the \ncurrent National Consolidated Guidelines for the Prevention of Mother-to-Child \nTransmission of HIV (PMTCT) and the management of HIV in Children, Adolescents and \nAdults as well as the current Guidelines for Maternity Care in South Africa.

Women who learn that they are HIV positive during pregnancy have a particular \nvulnerability to mental health conditions.  \nUntreated maternal mental illness is associated with the following: \n» unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, \n» poor adherence to health advice; poor uptake of antenatal services, \n» tobacco, alcohol and other substance use, \n» self-harm and suicide, \n» relapse of the mental illness during the pregnancy or postpartum, \n» gestational hypertension and/or diabetes, \n» poor pregnancy outcomes, including preterm labour and low birth weight,",

This location is intended to avoid large blood vessels \nand nerves lying within and surrounding the sulcus. If it is not possible to insert the \nimplant in this location (e.g. in women with thin arms), it should be inserted as far \nposterior from the sulcus as possible.  \n» Make two marks with a surgical marker: First, mark the spot where the implant will be\ninserted, and second, mark a spot at 5 cm proximal (toward the shoulder) to the first \nmark. This second mark (guiding mark) will later serve as a direction guide during \ninsertion.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n» Clean the insertion site with an antiseptic solution. \n» Anaesthetise the insertion area. \n» Insert the implant subdermally:\nLoE:IVb9\n- \nHold the applicator just above the needle at the textured surface area.

Alternatively, the trocar may be inserted directly through the skin without making \nan incision. \n» Open the implant pouch by pulling apart the ﬁlm of the pouch and let the two implants\ndrop on a sterile cloth. Note: Always use sterile gloves or forceps when handling the \nimplants. If an implant is contaminated (e.g. falls on the ﬂoor), leave it for later disposal, \nopen a new package, and continue with the procedure. \n» The implant is provided with a disposable trocar that is sharp enough to penetrate the\nskin directly. Thus, the disposable trocar can be used to puncture the skin and insert \nthe rods, without the need for an incision. \n» The trocar has two marks. One mark is close to the handle and one close to the tip.\nWhen inserting the implants, the mark closest to the handle indicates how far the \ntrocar should be introduced under the skin before loading each implant. The mark \nclosest to the tip indicates how much of the trocar should be left under the skin after \nthe insertion of the ﬁrst implant. When inserting the trocar, avoid touching the part of \nthe trocar that will go under the skin. \n» Once the tip of the trocar is beneath the skin it should be directed along the subdermal\nplane horizontally by pointing it slightly upwards and raising the skin (tenting).

Infections may be \ncomplicated or uncomplicated. Uncomplicated UTI is a lower UTI, where there are no \nfunctional or anatomical anomalies in the urinary tract, no kidney impairment, or no \nconcomitant disease that would promote the UTI. \nComplicated UTIs exist in patients with an increased chance of a complicated course, i.e. \nall men, pregnant women, patients with relevant anatomical or functional abnormalities of \nthe urinary tract, indwelling urinary catheters, kidney diseases, and/or other concomitant \nimmunocompromising diseases for example, diabetes.  \n \nDifferentiation of upper from lower urinary tract infection in young children is not \npossible on clinical grounds. \nUpper UTI is a more serious condition and requires longer, and sometimes intravenous, \ntreatment.  \n \nFeatures of upper UTI (pyelonephritis) that may be detected in adults and adolescents \ninclude: \n» flank pain/tenderness, \n» temperature 38°C or higher, \n» other features of sepsis, i.e.: tachypnoea, tachycardia, confusion, hypotension, \n» vomiting. \n \nIn complicated, recurrent, or upper UTIs, urine should be sent for microscopy, culture and  \n sensitivity.\nLoE:IVb6\nFeatures of urinary tract infections in children  \nSigns and symptoms are related to the age of the child and are often non-specific. \nUncomplicated urinary tract infections may cause very few signs and symptoms, while \ncomplicated infections may present with a wide range of signs and symptoms. \n \nNeonates may present with: \n» fever \n» hypothermia \n» poor feeding \n» sepsis \n» vomiting \n» prolonged jaundice \n» failure to thrive \n» renal failure",

The five \nspecies are: \n» Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), \n» Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax), \n» Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale), \n» Plasmodium malariae (P. malariae), \n» Plasmodium knowlesi (P. knowlesi). \nThe parasites are usually transmitted to humans by the bite of a vector mosquito. In South \nAfrica, P. falciparum is the most common and the most dangerous of the malaria species. \nMalaria caused by P. falciparum is an acute febrile illness that may progress rapidly to \nsevere disease if not diagnosed early and treated adequately. \nSymptoms and signs of malaria are non-specific. \nThe most important element in the diagnosis of malaria is a high index of suspicion in both \nendemic and non-endemic areas. Any person resident in or returning from a malaria area \nand who presents with fever (usually within 3 months of possible exposure to vector \nmosquito bites) should be tested for malaria.  The progression of P. falciparum malaria to \nsevere disease is rapid, and early diagnosis and effective treatment is crucial. Pregnant \nwomen, young children ≤5 years of age and people living with HIV/AIDS are at \nparticularly high risk of developing severe malaria. \n \nSymptoms and signs of malaria may include: \n» severe headache \n» shivering episodes\n10.7",

Chemoprophylaxis must be started before entering the \nmalaria area, and continued for a period of time after exiting the malaria area.\nGENERAL MEASURES \nAlways use preventative measures, in addition to pharmacological therapy,  against \nmosquito bites between dusk and dawn: \n» Use di-ethyl 3-methylbenzamid (DEET) insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets,\ninsecticide coils or pads. \n» Apply insect repellent to exposed skin and clothing. Aim for 30% DEET. Don’t get on\nlips, eyes, breaks in skin. \n» Wear long sleeves, long trousers and socks, if outside, as mosquitoes are most active\nat this time. \n» Visit endemic areas only during the dry season.\nMEDICINE TREATMENT \nProphylaxis\nCAUTION \nImmunocompromised patients, pregnant women and children <8 years of age should\navoid visiting malaria-endemic areas, as they are more prone to the serious\ncomplications of malaria.\nHowever, if this cannot be avoided, malaria chemoprophylaxis should be considered (as \nrecommended by the National Guidelines for the Prevention of Malaria (2018) found at: \nhttps://www.nicd.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/National-Guidelines-for-prevention-\nof-Malaria_updated-08012019-1.pdf\nHowever, as only doxycycline is provided in the public sector, alternative options for \npregnant women and children <8 years of age need to be purchased in the private \nsector.) \nNon-pregnant adults: \n• \nDoxycycline oral, 100 mg daily.\n10.12",

    "page_body": "YEARS OLD)\nDESCRIPTION  \nHIV replicates in CD4 lymphocytes and monocytes, leading to progressive destruction of \nCD4 lymphocytes and impaired immunity.  \nPrimary infection is characterised by: \n• \nglandular fever-type illness, \n• \nmaculopapular rash, \n• \nsmall orogenital ulcers. \nAfter primary infection, patients may have generalised lymphadenopathy and are usually \nasymptomatic for several years. Subsequently, if untreated, inflammatory skin conditions \nand an increased frequency of minor infections occur, followed by more severe infections \n(especially tuberculosis), weight loss and/or chronic diarrhoea. Eventually, severe \nopportunistic infections, HIV-associated cancers, or other severe HIV manifestations \ndevelop, known as the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\nDIAGNOSIS \n• \nProvide adequate pre- and post-test counselling. \n• \nEnsure patient confidentiality. \n• \nA positive rapid HIV test in adults must be confirmed with a 2nd rapid test from a \ndifferent manufacturer. If the screening and confirmation rapid test result differ, repeat \nthe tests. If the repeated test series differ, do a laboratory test (usually ELISA). \n• \nHIV antibodies are not detected during the 1st few weeks after infection. This is \nknown as the window period.\nPROGNOSIS \n• \nHIV disease progression is variable. The CD4 lymphocyte count and clinical features \nof immune suppression (see WHO staging below) both provide independent \ninformation on prognosis. Patients may be asymptomatic with very low CD4 counts \nor have severe clinical features with well-preserved CD4 counts. CD4 counts <200 \ncells/mm3 indicate severe immune suppression. All HIV-infected patients must have \na CD4 count and WHO clinical staging done at diagnosis.  \n• \nAll PLHIV are eligible for ART, irrespective of CD4 count or WHO stage. Patients \nshould be counselled about the benefits and risks of early ART initiation, and \nencouraged to initiate ART as soon as feasible. However, should a patient elect to \ndefer ART, the CD4 count should be repeated every 6 months until ART can be \ninitiated.",

    "page_body": "12.8 SYPHILIS SEROLOGY AND TREATMENT \nA53.9\nSyphilis serology \nThe Rapid Plasmin Reagin (RPR) measures disease activity, but is not specific for \nsyphilis. False RPR-positive reactions may occur, notably in patients with connective \ntissue disorders (false positive reactions are usually low titre <1:8). For this reason, \npositive RPR results should be confirmed due to syphilis by further testing of the serum \nwith a specific treponemal test, e.g.: \n» Treponema pallidum haemagglutination (TPHA) assay. \n» Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay. \n» Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody (FTA) assay. \n» Treponema pallidum ELISA. \n» Rapid treponemal antibody test (TPAb) \nScreening can also be done the other way around starting with a specific treponemal test \nfollowed by a RPR in patients who have a positive specific treponemal test. This is \nsometimes referred to as the “reverse algorithm”. \n- Once positive, specific treponemal tests generally remain positive for life and therefore\nthe presence of specific treponemal antibodies cannot differentiate between current \nand past infections \n- A person with previously successfully treated syphilis will retain lifelong positive\nspecific treponemal test results. \nThe RPR can be used:  \n» To determine if the patient’s syphilis disease is active or not,  \n» To measure a successful response to therapy (at least a fourfold reduction in  titre,\ne.g. 1:256 improving to 1:64), or  \n» To determine a new re-infection.  \nSome patients, even with successful treatment for syphilis, may retain life-long positive \nRPR results at low titres (≤1:8), which do not change by more than one dilution difference \n(up or down) over time (so-called serofast patients).  \nNote: \n» Up to 30% of early primary syphilis cases, i.e. those with genital ulcers may have  a\nnegative RPR. \n» The RPR is always positive in the secondary syphilis stage and remains high\nduring the first two (infectious) years of syphilis. \n \nFor syphilis treatment in pregnancy, see Section 6.4.4: Syphilis in pregnancy.\nLoE:II7",

These should be given according to the catch-up \nschedule which is shown in the table on page 13.4. \n» Mild illnesses are not a contra-indication to immunisation – most children who\nare well enough to be sent home, are well enough to be immunised. Do not \nimmunise a sick child if the mother seriously objects but encourage her to bring \nthe child for immunisation on recovery. \n» Give an extra dose if in doubt whether a child has had a certain dose or not, as\nextra doses are not harmful. \n» The measles/rubella vaccine must not be given with other childhood vaccines\nwhen administered at 6 months of age. The measles/rubella vaccine can be co-\nadministered with other vaccines from 9 months of age.  All other vaccines listed \nin the table below can be given safely at the same time but should not be given \nin the same syringe or at the same site. \n» Serious adverse events following immunisation are uncommon. All adverse\nevents should be reported. \n» For management of anaphylaxis associated with vaccinations, see Section\n21.2.10: Anaphylaxis.\nAdverse events following immunisation (AEFI) definition  \nAny untoward medical occurrence which follows immunisation, irrespective of whether \nthere is a causal relationship with the vaccine. The adverse event may be any \nunfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease. \nAll AEFI should be reported. Serious and severe AEFI or cluster of events are \ninvestigated, and causality assessed by the National Immunisation Safety Expert \nCommittee (NISEC) which is an independent committee appointed by the Minister of \nHealth. Further information is available in the vaccine safety surveillance in South Africa- \nManual for Surveillance and Response to Adverse Events Following Immunisation.",

Neonatal units should have a policy to \nensure vaccination occurs prior to hospital discharge. \n» \nRepeat dose of BCG vaccine \n- \nIf the infant initiates TPT or TB treatment in the first six weeks of life, the \neffectiveness of the live, attenuated BCG vaccine may be negatively impacted. \nTherefore, the BCG vaccine should be repeated on completion of either TPT or \nTB treatment. \n- \nInfants or children living with HIV should only receive a repeat dose if they are: \n1) on ART, 2) clinically well, and 3) have a CD4 > 25%. \n- \nIf the criteria to receive BCG are not met, i.e., the infant is: 1) Not on ART, 2) or \nUnwell, or 3) CD4 < 25%.\n• \nDelay repeat dose of BCG until on ART and immunologically stable \n(CD4 > 25%). \n• \nStart/continue TPT until the child is eligible to receive BCG. \n- \nAfter TPT/TB treatment is completed, a CD4 count should be done to determine \nif the infant meets the above criteria for receiving BCG even if the annual CD4 \ncount is not yet due. Do not wait for the routine annual CD4 count, as this delay \nmay result in many infants not receiving BCG at all. \n- \nIf the infant received the standard first-line TB treatment regimen BCG \nvaccination may be administered from 24 hours after the last anti-TB treatment \ndose. If the infant received rifapentine give BCG from 5 days after the last dose, \nand if the infant received bedaquiline or clofazamine give BCG vaccination two \nmonths after the last dose. \n» \nCatch-up dose of BCG vaccine \n- \nA ‘catch-up’ BCG should be administered to any child <10 years of age who did \nnot get a BCG at birth. \n- \nInfants or children living with HIV should only receive “catch up” BCG \nvaccination if they are: 1) on ART, 2) clinically well, and 3) have a CD4 > 25% \n(if ≤5 years of age) or >200 cells (if >5 years of age). \n- \nChildren older than > 10 years of age should not get BCG vaccination.\nCAUTION\nChildren with suspected or confirmed inborn errors of immunity or other acquired\nimmunodeficiencies should be evaluated by an expert before BCG vaccination.\n1 https://www.nicd.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Case-Report-Form_AEFI_All-vaccines-incl-COVID-19_20210128.pdf",

Epileptic seizures are classified by the International League Against \nEpilepsy (ILAE) into three types: focal, generalised, and unknown (see Figure 1). \nThe evolution of the seizure (how it starts and progresses clinically) directs \ninvestigations to determine the cause of the seizure and related management.  \n \nSEIZURE TYPES \nFocal seizures:  \nThe epileptic activity arises from a specific focus, or networks limited to one \nhemisphere of the brain.  \n \nFocal seizures may present with motor signs (e.g., rhythmic jerking of one limb; \nautomatisms such as lip-smacking) or with non-motor signs (e.g., olfactory, tactile, \nor visual hallucinations, or intense emotions such as fear). This depends on the \nsite of origin, which may be the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe or occipital \nlobe. A focal brain lesion should always be excluded in new focal seizures.  \n \nFocal seizures are classified according to the degree of impaired consciousness \nand whether there is progression to a tonic-clonic seizure.

Bilateral tonic-clonic seizures are differentiated from \ngeneralised tonic-clonic seizures by a history of preceding focal signs (either \nsensory or motor) occurring before complete loss of consciousness and the \ndevelopment of tonic-clonic movements. The terms ‘aura’ or ‘warning signs’ \nmay be used by people for the focal signs of the seizure. \n \nGeneralised seizures \nThe epileptic activity arises within and rapidly spreads to involve networks in both \nhemispheres of the brain.

Such epileptic seizures indicate the \nperson’s brain is predisposed to having seizures and therefore warrant a \ndiagnosis of epilepsy. \n» \nEpilepsy may be diagnosed after a single unprovoked seizure in people with \nan increased risk of recurrence for example in people with previous \nconditions such as TB meningitis, neurocysticercosis, stroke, brain tumour \nor traumatic brain injury. Note that the single unprovoked seizure is not \ncaused by the immediate insult to the brain but occurs spontaneously (i.e., \nis unprovoked) because of the long-term sequelae of the initial insult. The \ndamaged brain is thus at high risk of a recurrent unprovoked epileptic \nseizure. \n» \nEpileptic syndromes confer a diagnosis of epilepsy, even if the risk of \nrecurrent epileptic seizures is low for a particular individual. \n» \nEpilepsy is considered to be resolved and no longer needing maintenance \ntreatment in individuals who either: \n− \nhad an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome, but are now past the \napplicable age, OR \n− \nhave remained seizure-free for the last 10 years and weaned off ASM \nfor at least the last 5 years. \n» \nEpilepsy is associated with many psychological, social and legal problems, \nand cultural misperceptions which should be explored and addressed at the \ntime of diagnosis and throughout the course of the illness.",

They may occur in anxiety, mood, psychotic, or substance use \ndisorders, and are a marker of increased severity. \n» Psychological symptoms: panicky feelings, excessive worry, mood changes,\nirritability, tearfulness, distress, and difficulty concentrating. \n- \nPhobias are diagnosed when the anxiety is caused by a specific situation or \nobject, e.g. social phobia is the fear of social interactions. Thoughts are of negative \nevaluation by others and usually start in adolescence. Self-medication with alcohol \nor other substances before and during a social event is common. Substance \nmisuse may be the presenting feature. \n» Obsessive thoughts and/or compulsive behaviours are a core feature of Obsessive-\nCompulsive Disorder but may also occur in other anxiety, mood, developmental, and \npsychotic disorders. \n- \nIn people with intellectual disability, anxiety may present with aggression, \nagitation, and demanding behaviour.\nGENERAL MEASURES \n» Assess severity of the condition. \n» Maintain an empathic and concerned attitude. \n» Exclude underlying medical conditions and optimise treatment for comorbid medical\nconditions (e.g. heart disease, hypertension, COPD, asthma, GORD, inflammatory \nbowel disease, thyroid disease, epilepsy). \n» Screen for, and manage, underlying or co-morbid substance use, e.g. nicotine,\nalcohol, over the counter analgesics, benzodiazepines.",

It may be regarded as\na normal emotional state or it may be unacceptable to the sufferer due to stigma. \nThus, associated symptoms may be the presenting complaint rather than the low \nmood. In general, insomnia and loss of energy are the most common presenting \ncomplaints. In African cultures, somatic symptoms (bodily aches and pains) may \npredominate. Symptoms may also be masked in the interview setting. It is important \nto have a high degree of suspicion and to elicit symptoms, degree of impaired function, \nand suicide risk with care. \n \nDepression may present with: \n» Mood symptoms: may manifest as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, feeling\nempty, having no feelings, irritability, increased anger or frustration, bodily aches and \npains. \n» Loss of interest or pleasure (anhedonia): ‘not caring any more’, boredom, social\nwithdrawal, apathy, reduced sexual interest or desire. \n» Neuro-vegetative symptoms: loss of appetite or an increase in appetite, sometimes\nwith food cravings; weight loss or gain if appetite changes are severe; increased or \ndecreased sleep (usually mid- or terminal-insomnia, i.e. waking during the night or \nearly hours of the morning); psychomotor agitation (pacing, hand-wringing, rubbing of \nskin or clothing) or psychomotor retardation (slowed thoughts, speech and/or \nmovements); tiredness and fatigue – daily living tasks, e.g. getting dressed, are \nexhausting. \n» Psychological symptoms: feelings of worthlessness; unrealistic, negative self-\nevaluation; self-blame; and guilt – may be over minor failings or may be of delusional \nproportions.  \n» Cognitive symptoms: diminished ability to think, concentrate or make minor\ndecisions; may appear to be easily distracted; memory may be impaired (as in \npseudodementia); preoccupation with thoughts of death of loved ones, others, or self \n(from vague wishes to suicidal ideation or plans). \nThe presence of mood, psychological, and cognitive symptoms help to differentiate \nbetween depression and normal sadness/grief following a loss, or between depression \nand the loss of appetite and energy associated with a medical condition.",

Suicide \nrisk assessment is a process of estimating the probability for a person to commit suicide. \nThere are 5 important components when assessing suicide: ideation (thoughts), intent, \nplan, access to lethal means, and history of past suicide attempts. \nKey risk factors for suicide include previous suicide attempt, current suicidal plan or \nideation, and history of mental illness and/or substance abuse, access to lethal means, \nhistory of childhood sexual/physical abuse, family history of suicide and suicidality in \nmales, adolescents, elderly patients, and patients with alternative sexual orientations - \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) patients. (see Section 16.8.3: Special \nconsiderations: Sexual health and sexuality).\nWARNING \nSuicide risk assessment tools and guidelines should not replace clinical judgment.\nGENERAL MEASURES\nAny of the following factors may indicate a high risk of suicide: \n» Extreme hopelessness and despair. \n» Current thoughts/plan/act of self-harm/suicide. \n» History of self-harm/suicide.",

Monitoring and follow-up: \nFor all cases of medically serious acts of self-harm/suicide, or where there is an imminent \nrisk of self-harm/suicide: \n» Remove access to means of self-harm/suicide (bleach, pesticides, firearms,\nmedications) and medicines known to be toxic in overdose, including paracetamol, \namitriptyline, theophylline. \n» Maintain regular contact if possible – suggested weekly contact for the first 2 months.\nFollow-up for as long as the risk of self-harm/suicide persists. At every contact, re-\nassess for suicidal thoughts and plans. \n \n» Educate patient and family:\n- \nTo seek help from a trusted family member, friend, or health worker if they have \nany thoughts of self-harm/suicide. \n- \nThat family/carers may also need psychosocial support – provide patient with \nresources (e.g., brochures if available, SA Depression and Anxiety Group details \nhttps://www.sadag.org/). \n \n» Educate family/friend/carer:\n- \nTalking about suicide does not trigger the act of suicide and may lower the risk of \nfollowing through on suicidal ideation.  \n- \nWhere they may get support for their own mental health and to better support the \npatient.",

In susceptible patients, \nexposure to various environmental triggers, allergens or viral infections results in \ninflammatory changes, bronchospasm, increased bronchial secretions, mucus plug \nformation and, if not controlled, eventual bronchial muscle hypertrophy of the smooth \nmuscle in the airways.

It is affected by the patient's mood, morale, and the meaning the \npain has for the patient. Verbal description is only one of several behaviours to \nexpress pain; inability to communicate does not negate the possibility that the \npatient is experiencing pain.\nLoE:IVb1\nGENERAL MEASURES\n» \nEnquire about pain at all patient consults. \n» \nGeneral medical history is an important part of a pain history, as it reveals \nco-morbidities affecting the complexity of the pain condition. \n» \nCulture, gender and language play an essential role in how a patient reports \npain.  \n» \nActive pain assessment and self-report is the key to effective \npain management.  \n» \nDifferent pain assessment scales should be used for different ages and \nintellectual categories of patients. \n \nChoice of pain assessment tool: \n» \nThe gold standard of pain assessment is self-report. Consider using self-\nreport tools from >5 years (e.g. revised faces pain scale, visual analogue \nscales below).  \n» \nIf the child is unable to self-report, use the revised Face, \nLegs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (R-FLACC) scale. \n» \nIn non-verbal patients or patients with cognitive impairment, specific tools, \ne.g. the Abbey pain scale, may be used to assess pain: \nhttps://www.mdcalc.com/calc/3627/abbey-pain-scale-dementia-patients\nLoE:IVb2\nLoE:IIIb3\nLoE:IVb4\nRevised FLACC tool (R-FLACC)  \nInfants and children (2 months to 18 years old) - Behavioural pain assessment \ntool: \nThis tool can be used in children aged 2 months to 18 years and includes \ndescriptors for cognitively impaired children. The clinician assigns a score to \neach parameter, and tallies a score out of 10. The final score is used to \ndiagnose 1 to 3 (mild discomfort),  4 to 6 (moderate), or 7 to 10 (severe pain), \nwhich must be treated accordingly.\nLoE:IIIb5",

The reaction can be short-\nlived, protracted or biphasic, i.e. acute with recurrence several hours later. Immediate \nreactions are usually the most severe and/or life-threatening.  \nClinical features include: \n» \nAcute onset of signs and symptoms. \n» \nUrticaria (hives) or angioedema. \n» \nBronchospasm, wheezing, dyspnoea, chest tightness. \n» \nLaryngeal oedema with upper airway obstruction or stridor. \n» \nGastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea. \n» \nHypotension and/or shock. \n» \nDizziness, paraesthesia, syncope, sweating, flushing, dysrhythmias.\nGENERAL MEASURES \nAnaphylaxis associated with vaccinations: \n» \nAlways keep a fully equipped emergency tray at the vaccination point.  \n» \nIt is advisable to observe clients for 15 minutes after a vaccination. If a client is known \nwith severe allergies, an observation period of 30 minutes is advised. \n» \nClients who develop symptoms should be assessed for possible vaccination \nassociated anaphylaxis by considering the following: \n- \nIf signs and symptoms are generalised – involving more than 2 body systems, \nmanage as anaphylaxis. \n- \nIf signs and symptoms are serious or life-threatening, even if only one body \nsystem is involved (including hypotension, respiratory distress, significant \nswelling of lips or tongue), treat as anaphylaxis.  \n- \nIf isolated rash in an otherwise well client, monitor for 30 minutes. \n» \nCollapse following vaccination might be due to anaphylaxis or other causes such as \na vasovagal episode: \n- \nCall for help and put patient on his/her back and raise legs. \n- \nCheck if responsive – if unresponsive, commence CPR (See Section 21.1: \nCardiac arrest) \n- \nA vasovagal episode is usually associated with a transient loss of \nconsciousness (<1 minute), relieved by raising the legs when supine, transient \nlow BP and low HR. \n- \nCollapsing after vaccination usually occurs 5 to 10 minutes post-vaccination, \nbut can occur up to an hour afterwards. \n- \nTreat as anaphylaxis if loss of consciousness is not brief and not relieved by \nraising the legs, or if any of the signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis occur.",

    "page_body": "Palliative care improves the quality of life of patients facing life-threatening illnesses and \ntheir family members, regardless of whether or not they also receive life-prolonging \ntreatment. It requires a multidisciplinary approach, and aims to address physical, \npsychological, spiritual and social problems. \nGeneral principles of palliative care include:  \n» Treat the underlying causes of symptoms; \n» Minimise medicine side effects; and \n» Ensure that the patient and caregivers are informed of the nature of the disease,\ntreatment, side-effects, and likely outcomes. \nPalliative care patients who are down-referred from higher levels of care with a care plan \nshould be managed according to that plan. Palliative care patients should be assessed \nby community-based palliative care teams where available. \n \nThe SPICTTM-SA is a generic tool (https://www.spict.org.uk/the-spict/spict-sa/), designed \nfor the South African setting, to help identify adults with advanced life-limiting illnesses \nwhen the best available and appropriate treatment has been given and their condition \ncontinues to deteriorate.\nLoE:IVb1\nAlways refer to the latest National Department of Health Guidelines on\nPalliative Care.\nNote: Please be advised that the recommendations in this chapter are directed at treating \ncommon symptoms alongside disease directed care and symptoms associated with end-\nof-life care.\n22.1 GASTROINTESTINAL CONDITIONS\n22.1.1 CONSTIPATION \nK59.0 + (Z51.5) \nSee section 2.8: Constipation.\nDESCRIPTION \nThe underlying cause of constipation in palliative care patients may be functional, disease, \nor treatment related. Developmental disorders with or without cognitive deficits, mood and \nsituational circumstances can impact bowel habits in chronically ill children.\nGENERAL MEASURES \nEnsure privacy and comfort to allow a patient to defecate normally. \nIncrease fluid intake within the patient’s limits. \nEncourage activity and increased mobility within the patient’s limits. \nAnticipate the constipating effects of pharmacological agents, such as opioids, and \nprovide laxatives prophylactically.",

If such information is\navailable or if such a rechallenge is necessary, recurrence of the event is a strong\nindicator that the medicine may be responsible.)\n6. \nCan this reaction be explained by other causes (e.g. underlying disease/s; other\nmedicine/s; toxins or foods)? (It is essential that the patient is thoroughly\ninvestigated to decide what the actual cause of any new medical problem is. A\nmedicine-related cause should be considered, when other causes do not explain\nthe patient’s condition.)\nWhat types of reactions should be reported?\nThe following adverse drug reactions should be reported:\n• \nAll ADRs to newly marketed drugs or new medicines added to the EML.\n• \nAll serious reactions and interactions\n• \nADRs that are not clearly stated in the package insert.\n• \nAll adverse reactions or poisonings to traditional or herbal remedies\nReport even if you are not certain that the medicine caused the event.",

This may include clinic \npersonnel, infection control nurses, other hospital staff or private medical \npractitioners.

Measurements that improve by >20% strongly suggest a \ndiagnosis of asthma. (See Sections 16.1: Asthma, acute and 16.2: Asthma, \nchronic persistent).\nCALCULATING PEAK FLOW VARIABILITY IN CHILDREN AND \nADULTS \n• \nPerform peak flow measurements 4 times per day spread over the course \nof the day.   \n• \nSubtract the lowest reading of each day from the highest reading. \n• \nCalculate the mean/average reading by adding all 4 readings from that \nday and dividing total by 4. \n• \nCalculate PEF variability:\n(Highest PEF−Lowest PEF)\nMean PEF\n ×  100. \n \nDetermine this value on each day over two weeks, and average the results. \nExcessive diurnal PEF variability defined as >10% in adults and >12% in \nchildren strongly supports a diagnosis of asthma.\nPEF variability =",

Volume must be more than the equipment \ndead space to be sufficient. The dead space in a nebuliser refers to the \nvolume of the nebulizer chamber and tubing that remains filled with \nmedication after treatment. This volume is not delivered to the patient and \ncan vary depending on the nebulizer design. Typical dead space volumes in \njet nebulizers is 2-3 mL.   \n2. \nHold the nebuliser upright. \n3. \nSelect a flow rate of oxygen of 6 to 8 L/min for jet nebulisers. \n4. \nUse a mouthpiece rather than a facemask in adults and in any child able to \nhold a mouthpiece between their lips and breathe via their mouths.  \nBetter medication delivery: The T-piece allows for more direct delivery of \nmedication to the lungs, reduced medication loss, improved patient comfort, \nenhanced cooperation, reduced risk of skin irritation and easier observation \nof the patient's mouth and nose. \n5. \nPlace the mouthpiece in the patient’s mouth.
