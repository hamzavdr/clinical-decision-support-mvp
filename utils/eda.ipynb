         "I proudly present the updated 2024 editions of both the Primary Healthcare (PHC) and \nAdult Hospital Level (AHL) Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) and Essential \nMedicines List (EML). These guidelines aim to enhance transparency and support the \ndelivery of high-quality treatment options at both PHC and hospital levels. They reflect \nthe evolving clinical needs of our population as well as the introduction of new medicines.  \n \nUniversal Health Coverage (UHC) aims to eliminate disparities in healthcare access and \noutcomes, providing financial protection and access to quality healthcare for all South \nAfricans, as mandated by the constitution of South Africa. The National Essential \nMedicines List Committee (NEMLC) has incrementally increased the use of Health \nTechnology Assessment processes in the selection of essential medicines, providing \ntransparent priority-setting and value-based guidance for efficient resource allocation. The \nPHC and AHL STGs and EML are a key pillar of UHC, laying the groundwork for structuring \nhealth service benefits and ensuring equitable access to safe, effective and affordable \nmedicines for all.  \n \nI commend the diligent work of the PHC and AHL Expert Review Committee (ERC), along \nwith the NEMLC, in developing the 2024 editions of the PHC and AHL STGs and EML \naccording to good governance and evidence-based decision principles.  \n \nI encourage stakeholders across all sectors to actively participate in the continuous review, \ndevelopment and implementation of these guidelines. I encourage engagement with the \nNEMLC process of STG development through the external comment process. I appreciate \nyour engagement in presentations and webinars hosted by the NDoH, as well as \ndissemination of communication published on the National Department of Health web \npage. Your active involvement is crucial for the successful implementation of these STGs \nand the improvement of health outcomes for our nation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDR PA MOTSOALEDI, MP \nMINISTER OF HEALTH \nDATE: 25 June 2025",

         "INTRODUCTION \n \nThe Primary Healthcare (PHC) and Adult Hospital Level (AHL) Standard Treatment \nGuidelines (STGs) and Essential Medicines List (EML) enable the equitable access to \nsafe, effective and affordable essential medicines across South Africa.  \n \nHistorically, the PHC and AHL Expert Review Committees (ERCs) responsible for \ndeveloping the PHC and AHL STGs were appointed as separate Committees. However, \nin 2020 the Committees were merged to streamline efforts and optimise resources, \nensuring a seamless continuum of care between the PHC and AHL of care. The review \ncycle for these STGs commenced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating \na shift in priorities to address emerging needs and challenges faced by the healthcare \nsystem during the pandemic.  \n \nThe ERC reviews the STGs and EML according to a topic prioritisation framework that \nincludes consideration of clinical need, efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and \nequity, presenting recommendations to the National Essential Medicines List Committee \n(NEMLC) for appraisal and ratification. The multidisciplinary team, which includes clinical \nexperts, clinical pharmacologists and evidence-review and guideline-development \nmethodologists has strengthened the STG development process. The National \nDepartment of Health’s Essential Drugs Programme team supports this process and has \nensured collaboration and alignment with other advisory groups in updating these \nguidelines.  \n \nThe NEMLC has incorporated the latest advances in clinical care into various disorder and \nchapter updates, expanding medicine treatment options including (but not limited to) Blood \nand Blood-Forming Organs, HIV, Mental Health, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, as well as \nPalliative Care. Notably, the AHL STGs and EML features a new chapter on Adult Critical \nCare, developed through extensive consultation across both public and private sectors. \nThis chapter aims to enhance our response capabilities and ensure comprehensive care \nfor critically ill patients.  \n \nThe 2024 editions of the PHC and AHL STGs and EML reflects the National Department \nof Health’s commitment to continually evolving and enhancing the quality and accessibility \nof healthcare across our country.\nDR SSS BUTHELEZI \nDIRECTOR-GENERAL: HEALTH \nDATE: 11 June 2025",

         "THE ESSENTIAL MEDICINES CONCEPT\nThe WHO describes Essential medicines as those that satisfy the priority \nhealth care needs of the population. Essential medicines are intended to be \navailable within the context of functioning health systems at all times in \nadequate quantities, in the appropriate dosage forms, with assured quality \nand adequate information, and at a price the individual and the community \ncan afford. \n \nThe concept of essential medicines is forward-looking. It incorporates the \nneed to regularly update medicines selections to: \n» reflect new therapeutic options and changing therapeutic needs;  \n» the need to ensure medicine quality; and \n» the need for continued development of better medicines, medicines for\nemerging diseases, and medicines to meet changing resistance patterns. \n \nEffective health care requires a judicious balance between preventive and \ncurative services. A crucial and often deficient element in curative services is \nan adequate supply of appropriate medicines. In the health objectives of the \nNational Drug Policy, the government of South Africa clearly outlines its \ncommitment to ensuring availability and accessibility of medicines for all \npeople. These are as follows:  \n» To ensure the availability and accessibility of essential medicines to all\ncitizens.  \n» To ensure the safety, efficacy and quality of medicines.  \n» To ensure good prescribing and dispensing practices.  \n» To promote the rational use of medicines by prescribers, dispensers and\npatients through provision of the necessary training, education and \ninformation.  \n» To promote the concept of individual responsibility for health, preventive\ncare and informed decision-making.  \n \nAchieving these objectives requires a comprehensive strategy that not only \nincludes improved supply and distribution, but also appropriate and extensive \nhuman resource development. The implementation of an Essential Drugs \nProgramme (EDP) forms an integral part of this strategy, with continued \nrationalisation of the variety of medicines available in the public sector as a \nfirst priority. The private sector is encouraged to use these guidelines and \nmedicine list wherever appropriate. \n \nThe criteria for the selection of essential medicines for Primary Health Care in \nSouth Africa were based on the WHO guidelines for drawing up a national \nEML. Essential medicines are selected with due regard to disease prevalence, \nevidence on efficacy and safety, and comparative cost. \n \nThe implementation of the concept of essential medicines is intended to be \nflexible and adaptable to many different situations. It remains a national \nresponsibility to determine which medicines are regarded as essential.",

         "HOW TO USE THESE GUIDELINES",
         "Principles \nThe National Drug Policy1 provides for an Essential Drugs Programme (EDP) - \na key component of promoting rational medicines use. Medicines are included \nor removed from the Essential Medicines List (EML) following an evidence-\nbased review of safety and effectiveness and considering cost and other \nrelevant practice factors. The review process is dynamic, and starts with \nprioritisation of  chapters, medicines, or disease areas. The EML, STGs, and \nthe reviews informing them are then updated and published on an ongoing \nbasis.  Each  new review or update involves seeking input and comments from \nexternal stakeholders. Stakeholders are also given opportunity to input prior to \nfinal publication. All reasonable steps are taken to align the Standard Treatment \nGuidelines (STGs) with Department of Health guidelines available at the time of \nreview. Some recommendations might not be aligned with the indications or \ndoses included in South African Health Products Regulatory Authority \n(SAHPRA) approved professional information but are guided by the best \navailable scientific evidence.\nThe perspective adopted in the Primary Healthcare (PHC) STGs is that of a \ncompetent authorised prescriber practising in a public sector facility. The \nSTGs serve as a standard for practice but do not replace sound clinical \njudgment. It is important to remember that the treatments recommended are \nguidelines only, based on the assumption that prescribers can manage \npatients with the relevant conditions. This includes rational prescribing in the \nelderly and palliative care, as the use of some medicines, especially as people \nget older or more ill, can cause more harm than good. Optimizing medication \nuse through targeted de-prescribing is vital in managing chronic conditions, \navoiding adverse effects, improving outcomes, reducing pill burden, and \nmaintaining or improving quality of life.\nThe PHC EML and STGs allow for managing patients with relatively common \nconditions at the primary level of care. They also guide the referral of patients \nwith more complex or uncommon conditions to facilities with the skills and \nresources to provide further investigation and management. As such, they are \na progression to the Adult and Paediatric hospital-level EMLs and STGs.\nThe PHC STGs and EML should be used by healthcare workers providing \ncare at clinics, community health centres, mobile clinics, outreach \nprogrammes, and gateway or out-patient clinics at hospitals.  \nPharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committees (PTCs) are the primary \nimplementing bodies of medicine-related governance in the provinces, \ndistricts and health establishments in South Africa. They are a crucial \ncomponent of the medicine supply chain as the custodians of medicine \ngovernance and the rational selection and use of medicines at all levels of \n \n1 National Drugs Policy, 1996. https://www.gov.za/documents/national-drugs-policy\nxxviii",

         "Provincial PTCs are authorised to reasonably adapt the STGs/EML \naccording to local circumstances and available expertise, and to \nfacilitate and control access to medicines listed on the Adult and \nPaediatric hospital level EMLs at specific PHC facilities, where \nappropriate prescribers may be present.\nProvincial PTCs are also responsible for facilitating access to medicines at \nPHC level for specific patients through down-referral from higher levels of \ncare. This flexible approach aims to promote better utilisation of resources \nwhile providing access to healthcare that is more convenient for patients.\nGiven that the STGs and EMLs for the various levels of care are reviewed at \ndifferent times, there may be periods when they are not perfectly aligned. \nLikewise, updated STGs and EMLs will not always be synchronised with \npublic sector pharmaceutical tenders, and Provincial and local PTCs should \nfacilitate the phase in/out of the relevant essential medicines. \n \nLocal formularies \nA formulary is a continually updated list of medicines and related information \non the diagnosis, prophylaxis, or treatment of disease and the promotion of \nhealth to satisfy the needs of the majority of the population served by a \nparticular health establishment/s.3  \n \nAll EML medicines should be available at the relevant level of care based on \nthe package of services provided at a particular health establishment/s. PTCs \nshould develop formularies aligned to treatment guidelines and protocols \nsubjected to robust evidence-based interrogation and consideration of cost \nimplications. \n \nThe EML has been developed to the generic or International Non-Propriety \nName (INN) level. Each province, through the provincial PTC, is expected to \nreview the EML and prevailing tenders and compile a formulary which: \n» lists formulations and pack sizes that will facilitate care in alignment with the\nSTGs and EML; \n» selects the preferred member of a therapeutic class based on cost; and \n» implement formulary restrictions that are consistent with the local\nenvironment. \n \nTherapeutic classes are designated in the “Medicine treatment” sections of \nthe STGs, which provide classes of medicines followed by an example of each \nclass, such as ‘HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), e.g., simvastatin’. \nTherapeutic classes are designated where none of the class members offers \n \n2 South African National Department of Health. 2019.

         "any significant benefit over the other registered class members. It is \nanticipated that by listing a class rather than a specific medicine, there is \nincreased competition and, hence, an improved chance of obtaining the \nlowest possible price in the tender process.  \n \nWhere therapeutic classes are listed in the STGs, the local formulary should be \nconsulted to identify the specific medicine approved for the facility. A therapeutic \ninterchange database has been developed that lists medicines grouped into a \ntherapeutic class for a specific condition, as outlined in the policy for classifying \nmedicines into therapeutic classes for purposes of therapeutic interchange. The \ndatabase and policy are available on the National Department of Health website:   \n \nhttps://www.health.gov.za/nhi-hpp-edp/ \n \n \nNavigating the guidelines\nEach chapter covers a broad organ system, with cross-referral to other \nchapters where necessary. Within each chapter, conditions are usually listed \nalphabetically.  \n \nICD10 codes\nDiagnosis codes from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and \nRelated Health Problems (ICD-10) are included for each condition to facilitate \nthe accurate recording of diagnoses. The primary ICD-10 code may be \naccompanied by a secondary code that is bracketed to differentiate a secondary \nmanifestation from the primary aetiology. (For example, uncomplicated \nbroncho-pneumonia with severe penicillin allergy would be coded as: \nJ18.0+(Z88.0)). All the rules and guidelines for using ICD-10 must be applied as \nper the World Health Organization (WHO), the agreed South African Morbidity \nCoding Standards and Guidelines document, and the South African Master \nIndustry Table (MIT).  \nAvailable at: https://www.health.gov.za/icd-10-master-industry-table/ \n \nDiagnosis\nA brief description and diagnostic criteria for each condition are included to \nassist healthcare workers in making a diagnosis.\nMedicine treatment  \nMedicines may be listed in a preferential order (e.g., the first medicine is the \nfirst-line option, the second medicine is the second-line option, etc.). The \ndosing regimens provide the recommended doses for usual circumstances. \nThe actual dose prescribed should consider the patient’s capacity to eliminate \nthe medicine, interactions, and co-morbid states.\nxxx",

         "Paediatric dose calculation\nPaediatric doses are usually provided as weight-band dosing tables according \nto age. Doses should be calculated by weight, described as mg/kg. If this is \nnot possible, choose a dose from the weight-band tables. Only use the dose \naccording to age as a last resort. In particular, do not use age bands if the \nchild appears small for his/her age or is malnourished. Particular care should \nalso be exercised when treating neonates, as the doses provided for children \nmay not always be appropriate in this age group.\nDifferent conditions may require different doses of medicine. ‘Standard’ \npaediatric weight-band medicines dosing tables are in an appendix. Where a \nspecific condition is not listed in the appendix, refer to the STG in the main \ntext of the guidelines for the dose specific to that condition.  \n \n \nPrescription writing\nAll prescriptions must:\n» be written legibly in ink OR typed, and printed OR entered electronically,\nwhere such systems exist by the authorised prescriber, and signed with \nthe date on the prescription form (NOTE: only advanced electronic \nsignatures are acceptable, and require access to specific software \npackages); \n» include the full name, identification number and address of the patient;  \n» specify the age and, in the case of children, the weight of the patient;  \n» have prescriber details, including contact details, i.e., name,\nqualification, registration and/or practice number, address and contact \ntelephone number;\n» \nindicate the diagnosis on the prescription, where the patient has \nprovided consent.\nIn all prescriptions:\n» State the treatment regimen in full:\n• medicine name (preferably the generic name or INN), strength\nand formulation, \n• dose, \n• dose frequency, \n• route of administration, \n• duration of treatment, \n• e.g., amoxicillin 250 mg capsules, 8 hourly orally for 5 days. \n» Write the name of the full medicine/preparation using the generic name. \n» Avoid abbreviations to reduce the risk of misinterpretation. Avoid the\nGreek mu (ų): write mcg as an abbreviation for micrograms. \n» Avoid unnecessary decimal point use. If necessary, write a zero in front\nof the decimal point only, e.g., 2 mg, not 2.0 mg, or 0.5 mL, not .5 mL.\nxxxi",

         "CONDITIONS\nAchieving health goals for chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, HIV \nand AIDS, epilepsy, hypertension, mental health disorders and TB requires \nattention to: \n» Adherence to long term pharmacotherapy – incomplete or non-adherence\ncan lead to failure of an otherwise sound pharmacotherapeutic regimen.  \n» Organisation of health care services, which includes consideration of\naccess to medicines and continuity of care. \n \nPatient Adherence \nAdherence is the extent to which a person’s behaviour – taking medication, \nfollowing a diet and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed \nrecommendations from a health care provider.\nPoor adherence results in less than optimal management and control of the \nillness and is often the primary reason for suboptimal clinical benefit. It can \nresult in medical and psychosocial complications of disease, reduced quality of \nlife of patients, and wasted health care resources.\nPoor adherence can fall into one of the following patterns where the patient: \n» takes the medication very rarely (once a week or once a month); \n» alternates between long periods of taking and not taking their medication e.g.\nafter a seizure or BP reading; \n» skips entire days of medication; \n» skips doses of the medication; \n» skips one type of medication; \n» takes the medication several hours late; \n» does not stick to the eating or drinking requirements of the medication; \n» adheres to a purposely modified regimen; and \n» adheres to an unknowingly incorrect regimen.\nAdherence should be assessed on a regular basis.

         "AWaRe Classification of Antibiotics\nBACKGROUND \n \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has categorised antibiotics into three \ngroups based on their potential to induce and propagate resistance. This \ngrouping is also used to identify antibiotics that are priorities for monitoring \nand surveillance.  \n \nMost medicines remain effective even if used by many people for prolonged \nperiods. Unfortunately, antibiotics are an important exception as they can \nbecome ineffective because of anti-microbial resistance. \n  \nANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE \nAntibiotic resistance refers to the ability of microorganisms to withstand the \neffects of an antibiotic. \n  \nBacteria are said to develop resistance when they are no longer inhibited or \nkilled by a given antibiotic. \n \nInappropriate use of antibiotics favours the emergence and spread of \nantibiotic resistance, amplifying natural ability of bacteria to resist. \nIn order to keep antibiotics effective, we need to take them only when needed \nand strictly as directed by the prescriber / healthcare professional \n \nFurthermore, there is a need to select the right antibiotic for a given infection \nwhen they are needed. Those antibiotics that offer the best therapeutic \nadvantage while minimizing the risk of resistance should be privileged. \n \nThe aim of the WHO AWaRe antibiotic categorization is to provide a tool to \nuse antibiotics safely and effectively.",
