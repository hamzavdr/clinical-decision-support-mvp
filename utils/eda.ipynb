Refer to table \nbelow. \nThe use of appropriate cuff size is important. Too small a cuff for the arm leads to false \nhigh BP. The cuff bladder must encircle at least 80% of the upper arm and should cover \nat least 75% of the distance between the acromion and the olecranon. It is better to use \na cuff that is slightly too large than one that is too small. Large cuffs, if covered with linen-\nlike material, can be folded to the appropriate size in smaller infants as long as the bladder \nencompasses the arm. \nInfants and preschool-aged children are almost never diagnosed with essential \nhypertension and are most likely to have secondary forms of hypertension. \nWith age, the prevalence of essential hypertension increases, and after 10 years of age, \nit becomes the leading cause of elevated BP.
